        This page allows you to schedule a rebuild of all currently released 
        repacks, mainly useful when a new product version is released.

        <b><i>This has an irreversible effect on all repacks. If you need to preserve earlier versions of your customized browser, 
		please save those packages elsewhere. Do not press this button if you are uncertain about upgrading.</i></b>
    </p>

    <form method="POST" onsubmit="javascript:return confirm('Rebuild all releases, are you sure?')">
        <input type="submit" name="start" value="Rebuild all released repacks (<?=$repack_count?>)" />
    </form>
